/**
 * Each field in a document’s interactive form shall be defined by a field
 * dictionary, which shall be an indirect object. The field dictionaries may be
 * organized hierarchically into one or more tree structures. Many field
 * attributes are inheritable, meaning that if they are not explicitly specified
 * for a given field, their values are taken from those of its parent in the field
 * hierarchy. Such inheritable attributes shall be designated as such in the
 * Tables 220 and 221. The designation (Required; inheritable) means that an
 * attribute shall be defined for every field, whether explicitly in its own
 * field dictionary or by inheritance from an ancestor in the hierarchy. Table
 * 220 shows those entries that are common to all field dictionaries, regardless
 * of type. Entries that pertain only to a particular type of field are described
 * in the relevant sub-clauses in Table 220.
